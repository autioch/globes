# Globes

---
## *Work in progress.*

Simple game that I plan to develop in my free time.


Some thought about what can be done:
 - graphic settings (full eats the battery alive),
 - globes adding accelleration,
 - stats change messages,
 - pause option,
 - sounds option,
 - animations,
 - better calculation of available areas,
 - globe types:
    - normal
    - add life
    - take life
    - slow down
    - pause adding
 - mods:
    - moving globes
    - mist of war - darken regions slowly until clicked again
    - 3d - rotate the scene
    - changing background / theme
